# phighting-reference-sheets
## The character refs folder has individual files per phighter. You can request other reference sheets @cosmicplating on tiktok or bluesky. Not guaranteed to do it but I probably will anyways

reference sheets that will be updated as designs change. Feel free to use whenever you want.

I'd recommend downloading and not just viewing, but that's up to you

## If any stuff is retconned then contact me. I spent some time with my grubby hands searching for these images so some might be outdated
